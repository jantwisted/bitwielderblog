Have you ever thought of plugging your machine to the Internet and making it anonymous? If you have used Tor browser, I don't have to explain how powerful the Tor network is. There's a nice tutorial in the official Tor documentation, which explains transparently routing traffic through the Tor network.

I wrote WOWTor for the same purpose and it is fully based on this official documentation. WOWTor is a python script, which runs only in Debian with Python3+.
