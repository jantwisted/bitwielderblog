   THOUGH WE MAY BE MILES APART WE'RE ALWAYS UNDER THE SAME SKY!

It's always nice to have long distance friends, and why not getting a post card. In 2014, I officially started to travel around the world and I was able to meet good people who remain as friends still, even it's been some years and months now. I don't believe much in social networking, even though it sounds cool and efficient, so I decided to write them in snail mail.
