   THOUGH WE MAY BE MILES APART, WE'RE ALWAYS UNDER THE SAME SKY!

It's always nice to have long distance friends, and why not getting a postcard.
In 2014, I officially started to travel around the world and I was able to meet good people who remain as friends from miles away. As I don't believe much in social networking, even though it sounds cool and efficient, I have decided to write them in snail mail.

In this post, I'd like to share some of the  postcards I have as pictures (from a blurred camera) which I got from friends, from different countries.
